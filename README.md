## About Project

A front-end HTML interface for NFT Marketplace. Inspired by Axies Nft Marketplace template.
Axie Infinity is a turn-based play-and-earn card game that involves non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and virtual currencies. Itâ€™s most generally portrayed as a Pokemon-style game in which you engage with virtual pets named Axies rather than Pokemon.
